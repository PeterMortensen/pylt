What ?
======
This is a set of python classes for communicating with IEEE488/GPIB
instruments which I use in my private lab.

The base class is "pylt" - PYthon LabTools - which defines the generic
API that hides the particular details of getting HPIB working for
this instrument.

As a result, a typical python script for measuring something can look
almost readable:

	import u2004

	d = u2004.u2004()

	# 1MHz, -25 dBm, best resolution
	d.config(1e6, -25, 4)

	while True:
		print(d.measure())

Currently two hardware connections are supported:  Prologix USB-GPIB
adapter and direct USBTMC/USB488 connection.

It is possible to use multiple instruments on one GPIB bus controlled
by the Prologix at the same time.
